    "### How to Use:\n",
    "1. **Fill in or adjust any “Value” cells**—especially the financing costs if they differ by bucket.\n",
    "2. If you leave a bucket’s financing rows blank, the program will default to the **Global financing costs**.\n",
    "3. **Save this sheet exactly as a CSV** (e.g. “parameters.csv”).\n",
    "4. When you run `portable_alpha_model.py`, select this CSV when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure every bold‐labeled “Parameter” appears—otherwise the loader will skip unknown rows. The order does not matter, as long as column headers remain `Parameter,Value`.\n"

    "Construct a Monte Carlo framework that allocates a fixed pool of capital (e.g. \\$1 b) across three “sleeves” (Internal, External Portable-Alpha, and Active Extension), simulates joint returns on Index, In-House α, Extension α, and External PA α, and then reports portfolio metrics (annual return, volatility, VaR, tracking error, breach probability).\n",

    "1. **Separate “reference period”** used to compute index volatility σₙ, which in turn determines the cash/margin needed to synthetically hold 1:1 index exposure.  \n",
    "2. **Three explicit buckets** whose dollar-amounts sum to \\$ 1 b, avoiding any double-counting of β + α exposures.  \n",
    "3. **Active Extension bucket** that can be “150/50” or “170/70” long/short, specified by an “Active share (%)” input. By default, we assume 150/50 (i.e. Active share = 50 %) unless the user overrides.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Why a separate reference period?**  \n",
    "   - If you measure index volatility over the same window you analyze (e.g. 2015–2020), you capture “current regime” vol. Often, managers prefer a longer/different window (e.g. 2010–2014) to gauge typical funding volatility. That reference σₙ, times a multiple (e.g. 3×), tells you how much cash to set aside to back \\$ 1 b of index exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why Active share as a percentage?**  \n",
    "   - A “150/50” program has 150 % long and 50 % short = net 100 %. Its “active share” is reported as 50 %.  \n",
    "   - If you want “170/70,” then active share = 70 %.  \n",
    "   - The code converts “Active share (%)” to decimal \\(S\\). For a 150/50 program, the default is 50 % (\\(S = 0.50\\)).\n",

    "   - Whenever you give \\$ X m to External PA, that manager holds the index exposure on your behalf. You do not hold margin for that portion. Similarly, the Active Extension manager holds their own index.  \n",
    "   - On your books, you only need to hold margin for a single \\$ 1 b index. That is \\(W\\).  \n",
    "   - Once you hand \\$ X m to external PA and \\$ Y m to active ext, **both managers** hold \\((X + Y)\\) of index on your behalf. So your margin \\(W\\) backs the *entire* \\$ 1 b, not just the “leftover” portion.\n",
