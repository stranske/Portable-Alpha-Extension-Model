Additionally, the implementation of regime-specific covariance and correlation matrices is implied by the integration of these parameters into the simulation. Tests were updated to cover regime integration, indicating that this task is also completed. However, there is no clear evidence that the tasks related to specifying multiple regimes and switching regimes according to transition probabilities have been fully completed, as they are still in the planning or implementation stages. The ruff check and mypy pass are noted as next steps, indicating they have not yet been completed.", "data_source": "jsonl", "input_length": 305359, "analysis_text_length": 13521, "effort_score": 75, "data_quality": "high", "session": {"event_count": 255, "message_count": 1, "command_count": 71, "file_change_count": 17, "todo_count": 0}}
