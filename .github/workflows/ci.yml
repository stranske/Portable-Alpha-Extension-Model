# PAEM CI Workflow - Consumer of stranske/Workflows
# Delegates to reusable workflow, no local scripts required
#
# This workflow runs:
# - Lint (Ruff)
# - Type check (mypy)
# - Tests (pytest) with coverage
#
# NOTE: PAEM uses single Python version (3.12) on Linux only
# Multi-platform matrix dropped per transition decision 2025-12-29
