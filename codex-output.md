I couldn’t find any failing checks to fix. The run summary says “Conclusion: cancelled” and “Failing jobs: none reported,” and there are no CI logs in the workspace to diagnose. I didn’t make any code changes.

If you can share the specific failing job log or a new run summary, I can target a fix. Suggested next steps:
1) Re-run the CI job and share the failing step output.
2) Paste any relevant logs from the Actions run for the failing check.
