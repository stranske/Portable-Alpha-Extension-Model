I couldn’t locate any CI failure details in the workspace. The run context says “Failing jobs: none reported,” and there are no logs or summaries available locally to diagnose. I didn’t make any code changes.

If you can share the failing job logs or the specific check name/command from CI, I can make a targeted fix.
