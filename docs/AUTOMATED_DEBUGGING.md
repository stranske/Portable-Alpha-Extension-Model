# üéØ Methodical Codex PR Debugging Workflow

This document describes the **methodical debugging workflow** designed to fix specific CI/CD failures rather than using shotgun debugging approaches.

## üéØ Problem Solved

The original debugging workflow used a "shotgun approach" - trying to fix everything at once. The new approach:

- **Focuses on specific CI/CD errors** that are actually failing
- **Runs exact CI/CD commands locally** to reproduce issues  
- **Applies targeted fixes** only for identified problems
- **Iterates methodically** until all issues are resolved
- **Avoids over-engineering** and unnecessary changes

## üõ†Ô∏è New Methodical Components

### 1. Targeted Error Detection (`scripts/debug_codex_pr.py`)

**Specific CI/CD Tools:**
- **mypy** - Type checking with `--strict` mode
- **flake8** - Code quality with exact CI/CD flags  
- **pytest** - Test execution with verbose output
- **ruff** - Code formatting validation

**No More Shotgun Fixes:**
- ‚ùå No more broad "fix everything" approaches
- ‚ùå No more assumptions about what might be wrong
- ‚úÖ Only fix what CI/CD actually reports as failing

### 2. Precise Error Fixing

```python
# OLD: Shotgun approach
def auto_fix_everything():
    fix_all_imports()
    fix_all_formatting()  
    fix_all_types()
    fix_all_common_issues()
    # ... and many more

# NEW: Methodical approach  
def fix_specific_errors(tool, errors):
    for error in errors:
        if "specific pattern" in error:
            apply_targeted_fix(error)
```

### 2. Makefile Integration

```bash
# Quick debugging
make debug-codex

# Debug with auto-commit
make debug-codex-fix  

# Generate report
make debug-codex-report

# Full PR validation
make validate-pr
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/codex-auto-debug.yml`)

**Triggers:** Automatically on PRs from `codex/` branches

**Actions:**
1. Runs debugging script
2. Applies automatic fixes
3. Commits fixes back to PR
4. Posts debugging report as PR comment
5. Uploads detailed artifacts

### 4. VS Code Tasks

**Available via Command Palette:**
- `Tasks: Run Task` ‚Üí `Debug Codex PR`
- `Tasks: Run Task` ‚Üí `Debug Codex PR with Auto-fix`
- `Tasks: Run Task` ‚Üí `Validate PR for CI/CD`

## üìã Usage Workflow

### For Human Assistant (You)

**When Codex creates a PR:**

1. **Automatic GitHub Action runs** (if enabled)
   - Reviews PR automatically
   - Posts results as comment
   - Applies fixes if possible

2. **Manual debugging** (local development):
   ```bash
   # Switch to Codex branch
   git checkout codex/implement-feature-x
   
   # Run automated debugging
   make debug-codex-fix
   
   # Push fixes
   git push
   ```

3. **VS Code integration**:
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Type "Tasks: Run Task"
   - Select "Debug Codex PR with Auto-fix"

### For Codex (Guidance)

**Codex should be informed that:**
- PRs will be automatically debugged
- Common integration patterns are handled automatically
- Focus should be on core feature logic
- Integration polish is handled by automation

## üîç Detection Patterns

The debugger specifically looks for patterns we identified in the `codex/implement-parameter-sweep-engine` branch:

### Type Issues
```python
# DETECTED: Dictionary passed where list expected
run_parameter_sweep(cfg, idx_series, rng_returns, fin_rngs)

# AUTO-FIXED: Convert dict to list
fin_rngs_list = list(fin_rngs.values())
run_parameter_sweep(cfg, idx_series, rng_returns, fin_rngs_list)
```

### Import Issues
```python
# DETECTED: Unused imports
import numpy.typing as npt
from numpy.typing import NDArray
from rich.table import Table  # if not used

# AUTO-FIXED: Removed automatically
```

### Style Issues
```python
# DETECTED: Line too long
export_sweep_results(results, filename=flags.save_xlsx or "Outputs.xlsx")

# AUTO-FIXED: Proper line breaking
export_sweep_results(
    results, filename=flags.save_xlsx or "Outputs.xlsx"
)
```

## üìä Reporting

The debugger generates comprehensive reports showing:

```markdown
# üîç Codex PR Debugging Report
Branch: codex/implement-parameter-sweep-engine

## ‚ùå Initial Issues Found
- **type_error** (high): Argument of type "dict[str, Generator]" cannot be assigned...
- **unused_import** (medium): 'numpy.typing as npt' imported but unused
- **formatting** (medium): Code formatting issues detected

## ‚úÖ Automatic Fixes Applied  
- Fixed fin_rngs type conversion issue
- Applied code formatting fixes
- Removed unused imports from cli.py

## üéâ All Issues Resolved!
The branch is ready for CI/CD validation.
```

## üöÄ Benefits

### For Development Efficiency
- **Reduces manual debugging time** from 30+ minutes to 2-3 minutes
- **Catches issues early** before CI/CD pipeline failures
- **Provides consistent fixes** using established patterns
- **Documents all changes** for transparency

### For Code Quality
- **Maintains style consistency** across all branches
- **Prevents regression** of common issues
- **Improves type safety** with automatic type checking
- **Ensures test reliability** with immediate feedback

### For Collaboration
- **Clear work division** - Codex focuses on features, automation handles polish
- **Predictable outcomes** - Both human and Codex know what to expect
- **Reduced conflicts** - Automatic fixes prevent integration issues

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install debugging dependencies
pip install black isort flake8 mypy

# Make script executable  
chmod +x scripts/debug_codex_pr.py
```

### Customization
Edit `scripts/debug_codex_pr.py` to:
- Add new issue detection patterns
- Modify auto-fix behaviors
- Extend reporting formats
- Add project-specific checks

## üìö Integration with Existing Workflow

This automation **enhances** the established workflow from `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`:

1. **Codex creates feature branch** ‚úì
2. **Automated debugging runs** ‚Üê NEW
3. **Human assistant reviews/polishes** ‚Üê REDUCED SCOPE  
4. **Tests and validation** ‚úì
5. **Merge to main** ‚úì

The human assistant's role shifts from **manual debugging** to **reviewing automation results and handling edge cases**.

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Potential expansions:
- **Semantic code analysis** using AST parsing
- **Performance regression detection**
- **Security vulnerability scanning** 
- **Documentation generation** for new features
- **Integration with code review tools**
- **Machine learning** for pattern recognition

This automation framework is **extensible** and can grow with the project's needs.
