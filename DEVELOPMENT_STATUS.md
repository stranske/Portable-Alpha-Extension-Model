# Development Status Update

**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Issue:** Codex attempted to fix already-working code

## What Happened

1. **Codex created branch:** `origin/codex/implement-updates-from-agents.md`
2. **Attempted to fix:** `pa_core/agents/active_ext.py` active_share handling
3. **Result:** Broke `test_agent_math_identity` test
4. **Problem:** The code was already fixed correctly in main branch

## Analysis

### Codex's Change (PROBLEMATIC)
```python
# Codex's approach
active_share = float(self.extra.get("active_share", 0.5))
if active_share > 1:
    active_share /= 100.0
```

### Current Working Code (CORRECT)
```python
# Our working implementation  
active_share = (
    float(self.extra.get("active_share", 50.0)) / 100.0
)  # Convert percentage to decimal
```

### Why Codex's Change Failed
- **Test expectation:** `share = 0.7` (70% as decimal)
- **Codex's logic:** If input is 0.7, keeps it as 0.7 (correct by accident)
- **But:** Changes the default from 50.0→0.5, breaking percentage convention
- **Result:** Test calculations don't match expected values

## Resolution

1. **✅ Delete Codex's branch** - The fix is unnecessary and harmful
2. **✅ Update documentation** - Make it clear what's already working
3. **✅ Provide clear guidance** - Focus Codex on new features, not fixes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Need better communication** about what's already fixed
2. **Need clear priorities** about what Codex should work on
3. **Need status documentation** to prevent duplicate work

## Next Steps

1. Human assistant handles this type of debugging/fixing
2. Codex focuses on NEW features (parameter sweep engine)
3. Better coordination through updated documentation

**Branch Status:**
- `main` - ✅ Working correctly, all core features functional
- `origin/codex/implement-updates-from-agents.md` - ❌ Should be deleted, contains problematic changes
